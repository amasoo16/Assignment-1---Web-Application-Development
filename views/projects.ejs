            <h2>Project 1: BugSmasher Game</h2>
            <p>
                BugSmasher is an interactive web-based game that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, players are challenged to test their hand-eye coordination and reaction time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core concept of the BugSmasher Game involves a virtual bug that moves randomly around the game screen. The objective is simple: players must click on the bug to earn points. However, if they miss the bug, it results in a deduction of points. The game allows users to reset the bug's movement speed for added difficulty or to practice their skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                BugSmasher is not only an entertaining pastime but also a testament to my proficiency in front-end web development and interactive game design. It showcases my ability to create engaging and responsive web applications that provide enjoyable user experiences.

            <h2>Project 2: Snake Game</h2>
            <img src="project2.png" alt="Snake Game">
             <p>
            The Snake Game is an engaging web-based application that I developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This classic game offers players an entertaining and challenging experience that tests their strategic thinking and reflexes.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the Snake Game, players take control of a pixelated snake that continuously moves around the game area. The primary objective is to guide the snake to collect dots or "food" items that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake consumes a dot, it grows longer, adding an extra layer of complexity to the game. However, if the snake fails to capture a dot, it gradually shortens in length. Additionally, as the player accumulates more points by collecting dots, the game's pace increases, intensifying the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Snake Game serves as a testament to my proficiency in game development and showcases my ability to create engaging, user-friendly, and responsive web-based games. It offers players an entertaining and nostalgic gaming experience that hones their strategic skills while providing hours of enjoyment.

            <h2>Project 3: Radio Player</h2>
            <p>
                The School-Built Radio Assembly project stands as a testament to my expertise in electronics engineering and hands-on experience in constructing complex electronic devices. During my tenure in an Electronics Engineering program, I embarked on this ambitious undertaking to design, fabricate, and assemble a fully functional radio receiver from fundamental components.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was a remarkable synthesis of theoretical knowledge and hands-on skill application, fostering a deeper understanding of electronic components, circuit design, and RF technology. The School-Built Radio Assembly project epitomizes my dedication to the field of electronics engineering, my problem-solving acumen, and my commitment to delivering high-quality results in complex engineering endeavors.
